# World-Happiness-Analysis
Data Science Fundaments COMP3125 Final Project 

Full report found here. The following is a brief summay of the project.

## Introduction	
This project explores world happiness, focusing on the factors contributing to happiness and how these factors vary across different countries and demographic groups. 

## Selection of Data
The educational data used in this study was sourced from UNESCO, a renowned international organization that specializes in promoting education, science, and culture. UNESCO offers a wide range of data related to education, including global indicators on learning outcomes, literacy rates, and educational attainment. The data was generated through extensive surveys, country reports, and collaborations with national governments and international organizations. Along with this, I used data from the World Happiness Report, a global survey that ranks countries based on subjective well-being, also known as happiness. The World Happiness Report is updated annually, with the most recent dataset being from 2024. 

##  Characteristics of data
The UNESCO and World Happiness Report datasets vary in format, size, and the parameters they contain. To deal with discrepancies in the country lists and formats between the two sources, I created two additional datasets for regional mapping. This allowed for the proper alignment of happiness data across the same regions, ensuring that no critical data was omitted. 

## Methods
I created a time series analysis to examine how global happiness levels have fluctuated over time. This approach involved calculating the annual average happiness score ("Life Ladder") for each year in the dataset and plotting this against time to observe any trends or patterns. 

In addition to time series, I examined correlations between global happiness and other factors, including region, education, and economic stability. This analysis aimed to understand the relationships between these factors and happiness levels, which can provide insights into what drives happiness.

## Results

## Discussion	What might the answer imply and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What are the perspectives for future research?
